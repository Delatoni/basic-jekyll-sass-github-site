# Foundation
This will be my foundation/starting point for starting a new clean Jekyll project. It will include a few extra features like Bower to help pull in 3rd party packages like Susy, Sass MQ, ect. that I'll be using in every project I start. Also it helps manage what version of a package I'll be using along with lock it down if need be.

Built with:
  * Jekyll
  * SASS/SCSS

Includes:
  * [Bower](http://bower.io/)
  * [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/)
  * [Sass MQ](https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq)
  * [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
  * [Sidr](http://www.berriart.com/sidr/)
